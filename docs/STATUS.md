## Current gate

Next: M3-R1 pure Rust allocation, offer-pair clearing and settlement domain model.

M3-R1 may not modify persistent NEAR state. It must first pass deterministic allocation, conservation, partial-default, overflow and replay-oriented domain tests.

Historical M1/M2 evidence follows. It remains evidence for earlier checkpoints, not proof of M3.

## M2/07A — Capital drift measurement

Local NEAR Sandbox, 2026-11-03.

- Starting commit: `dd93929`.
- Rust and compatible WASM unchanged.
- Six sequential task creation transactions PASS.
- Initial free capital: 0.08000000 NEAR.
- Six creation bonds: 0.12288000 NEAR.
- Persistent storage growth: 1883 bytes.
- Actual storage stake growth: 0.01883000 NEAR.
- Additional contract balance inflow: approximately
  0.00018419 NEAR.
- Net free capital reduction: approximately
  0.01864580 NEAR.
- Remaining free capital: 0.06135419 NEAR.
- Remaining capital after payout buffer:
  0.04087419 NEAR.

The entire creation bond remains recorded as a
storage reserve liability while actual allocated
storage separately increases the backing requirement.

This causes measured free-capital consumption despite
the user's storage prepayment.

The test accounts for additional observed contract
balance inflows rather than assuming exact equality
between attached deposits and balance changes.

This is one measured workload, not a universal
capital bound or proof of insolvency.

The audit is optional and is not yet part of the
eleven-suite default Sandbox regression.

Run independently:

`npm run sandbox:capital-drift`

Next: classify permanently consumed storage capital,
refundable balances and retained-record ownership
across mixed terminal and withdrawal lifecycles.

Production funds remain NOT APPROVED.

## M2/07B — Mixed lifecycle capital audit

Local NEAR Sandbox, 2026-11-03.

- Base commit: `650983c`.
- Original M2/06C ownership audit preserved.
- Rust contract and WASM unchanged.
- 23 state snapshots collected.
- Two buyers, two reserve providers, outsider caller.
- Unauthorized early releases rejected.
- Two funded tasks cancelled.
- Four collateralized offers released.
- Replay protection PASS.
- Ownership and financial conservation PASS.
- Native storage rebate withdrawal PASS.
- Initial free capital: 0.12000000 NEAR.
- Net storage growth: 2339 bytes.
- Storage stake growth: 0.02339000 NEAR.
- Net capital reduction: approximately 0.02251805 NEAR.
- Final free capital: approximately 0.09748195 NEAR.
- Final guarded capital: approximately 0.07700195 NEAR.
- Remaining recorded storage reserve: 0.24394000 NEAR.

The observed financial ledger remained conserved
through the tested releases and native withdrawal.

Recorded storage reserves remain protected as
liabilities in addition to actual storage stake.

All sampled states maintained nonnegative surplus.

Intermediate funding transitions were not all
sampled individually.

This is a bounded local lifecycle experiment,
not an exhaustive solvency or concurrency proof.

Optional regression:

`npm run sandbox:capital-lifecycle`

Next: classify consumed versus refundable storage
capital and model minimal-capital operation.

No production funds approved.

## M2/07C — Shadow storage reconciliation

- Base: `53ca3a9`.
- Local Sandbox shadow reconciliation PASS.
- 23 observed states.
- Hypothetical consumed storage: 0.02339 NEAR.
- Hypothetical unused reserve: 0.22055 NEAR.
- Conservative free capital: 0.09748195 NEAR.
- Shadow free capital: 0.12087195 NEAR.
- No on-chain economic or storage logic changed.
- No per-owner refund eligibility established.
- Shadow identity is algebraic, not a
  standalone security or solvency proof.

Optional regression:

`npm run sandbox:capital-shadow`

Proposed implementation requirements:

`docs/STORAGE_RECONCILIATION_ADR.md`

General storage refunds, migration and
production solvency remain unverified.

## M2/07D/1 — Pure Rust storage ledger model

Base commit: `4eb25a7`.

An isolated Rust arithmetic model has been created in:

- `src/storage_ledger_model.rs`
- `tests/storage_ledger_spec.rs`

Six new tests PASS. The existing 108 Rust unit tests
remain unchanged and PASS.

The model tracks payer, original contribution,
consumed capacity, unused capacity and simulated
released credit for four record categories.

Its accounting invariant is:

total = consumed + unused + released

This model does not modify the NEAR contract state,
WASM interface, withdrawal guard or escrow ledger.

Security limitations:

- Release eligibility is not authenticated.
- Storage deltas are not independently authenticated.
- Shared storage attribution remains unresolved.
- Future storage growth has no proven upper bound.
- Repeated partial simulated credits are not
  protected by a trusted one-time event identity.
- Caller-provided event IDs alone would not
  constitute sufficient replay protection.
- State migration remains unimplemented.

Next: M2/07D/2 — event identity, replay protection,
trusted storage attribution and adversarial tests.

No production funds approved.

## M2/07D/2 — Isolated event replay guard

Base commit: `e123e15`.
Date: 2026-11-03.

New files:

- `src/storage_event_guard.rs`
- `tests/storage_event_guard_spec.rs`

Verified local results:

- Seven event guard tests PASS.
- Thirteen tests in combined event guard target PASS.
- Six original storage ledger tests PASS.
- 108 existing contract unit tests PASS.
- Clippy, formatting and WASM target checks PASS.

Verified model properties:

- An identical event ID cannot be processed twice.
- Reusing an ID against another owner is rejected.
- Payer mismatch is rejected.
- Invalid arithmetic does not mutate the ledger.
- Failed operations do not consume event IDs.
- Processed restore events cannot be replayed.
- Tested balances preserve ledger conservation.

These tests verify an isolated arithmetic and
event bookkeeping model, NOT NEAR authorization.

Remaining security gaps:

1. Event authenticity is not established.
2. Distinct event IDs can describe the same physical
   storage change; global byte uniqueness is unproven.
3. Unused capacity alone does not prove refund
   eligibility or finality of a record.
4. The event source is simulated in unit tests.
5. The in-memory BTreeSet and full Book cloning are
   not approved on-chain persistence/gas strategies.
6. Allocation of shared storage and future mutation
   capacity remains unresolved.
7. Persistent state migration remains unimplemented.

The current contract storage backing and withdrawal
rules must remain unchanged.

Next gate: M2/07D/3 — derive event provenance from
trusted state transitions, measure actual storage
deltas, and prevent double attribution even when
different event IDs are presented.

Production funds remain NOT APPROVED.

## M2/07D/3 — Canonical offer finality and provenance

Base commit: `8730a6c`.
Date: 2026-11-03.

### Isolated Rust model — M2/07D/3A

- Canonical key: OfferFunding(offer_id).
- The first successful simulated credit finalizes
  that funding record in the isolated model.
- Further allocation, restoration or credit against
  that record is rejected, even with another event ID.
- Failed credit does not finalize the record.
- Other offer funding records remain independent.
- TaskFunding finality is NOT defined by this gate.
- 17 tests PASS in the event-guard test target.

The in-memory model is not connected to NEAR state.
Its terminal credit does not independently establish
the entitlement or completeness of a real refund.

### Real NEAR Sandbox — M2/07D/3B

- Two buyers, two reserve providers, one outsider.
- Four funded offers released after task cancellation.
- Four distinct-account replay attempts rejected.
- Original provider receives collateral and rebate,
  regardless of which eligible actor triggers release.
- Four released offer collateral records are absent.
- Unreleased offers remain available and funded.
- Measured net storage reductions: 3, 3, 88, 88 bytes.
- Total measured release reduction: 182 bytes.
- Total storage rebate: 0.00182 NEAR.
- Cross-owner financial accounting PASS.
- Native rebate withdrawal PASS.

The Sandbox checks the CURRENT contract's existing
offer state machine, not integration of the new ledger.

### Limitations

- Source and destination of every shared storage byte
  are not yet independently attributed.
- The physical storage delta cannot be submitted as
  an arbitrary caller-provided credit entitlement.
- An event ID is not evidence of storage release.
- Other record categories have no general finality
  and refund policy.
- New persistent structures, gas costs, contract
  state migration and minimal-capital operation
  remain unverified.

No changes to the contract's withdrawal backing
rule or persistent NEAR state were made.

Optional Sandbox regression:

`npm run sandbox:provenance`

Next: design the trusted transition-to-ledger bridge,
including exact allocation boundaries and persistent
storage cost attribution.

Production funds remain NOT APPROVED.

## M2/07E/1 — Raw NEAR storage key attribution

Base commit: `8e3a580`.
Local NEAR Sandbox, 2026-11-03.

Four funded, unselected offers were released.
Raw persisted key/value differences were inspected
through NEAR Sandbox view_state.

Measured results:

- Four offer funding records deleted.
- Each deleted record occupied 88 bytes.
- Total deleted storage: 352 bytes.
- First claimable creation for each provider:
  85 bytes.
- Two new claimable records: 170 bytes.
- Existing claimable updates added zero bytes.
- Net storage released: 182 bytes.
- Storage rebates: 0.00182 NEAR.
- Raw KV deltas matched storage_usage changes.
- Four cross-caller replay attempts rejected.
- Original reserve providers received the credits.
- Native refund withdrawal PASS.

Specific release deltas: 3, 3, 88, 88 bytes.

The 85-byte claimable allocation depends on the
tested account identifiers and storage encoding.
It is not a universal constant.

The observed 40-byte per-key overhead was checked
against the measured NEAR storage_usage delta.

This is read-only external storage inspection.
The contract does not expose raw storage keys.

The audit proves exact attribution of the inspected
key changes in this local scenario, not ownership
of all shared or future storage allocations.

Rust contract, persistent state and WASM unchanged.

Optional regression:

`npm run sandbox:storage-keys`

Next: M2/07E/2 — per-transition storage cost
attribution, including retained records, shared
writes and future mutation capacity.

The isolated storage ledger is not on-chain.
General storage refunds are not approved.
Production funds remain NOT APPROVED.

## M2/07E/2A — Complete storage transition matrix

Base commit: `387dff9`.
Local NEAR Sandbox, 2026-11-03.

### Verified physical measurements

- 21 successful state transitions instrumented.
- Each raw KV delta reconciled against storage_usage.
- Total persistent growth: 2339 bytes.
- Difference between reconstructed and actual
  storage usage: zero bytes.
- Four funded offer records deleted.
- Four cross-caller replay attempts rejected.
- Native refund withdrawal PASS.
- Existing contract WASM unchanged.

### Retained storage after lifecycle

| Category | Records | Bytes |
|---|---:|---:|
| Tasks | 2 | 334 |
| Task creation bonds | 2 | 186 |
| Task funding | 2 | 270 |
| Offers | 4 | 460 |
| Offer creation bonds | 4 | 384 |
| Settlement markers | 2 | 112 |
| Claimable balances | 4 | 336 |
| Shared or unknown | 1 | 257 |
| TOTAL | 21 | 2339 |

Named record categories account for 2082 bytes.
The remaining 257 bytes were classified as
shared_or_unknown, not assigned to a customer.

### Transaction groups

- Task creation: +777 bytes, including 257 bytes
  classified as shared_or_unknown.
- Task funding: +270 bytes.
- Primary acceptance: 0 net bytes.
- Offer posting: +844 bytes.
- Offer funding: +352 bytes.
- Task cancellation: +278 bytes.
- Offer release: -182 bytes.
- Native withdrawal: 0 net bytes.

Total: +2339 bytes.

All amounts above describe the tested workload.

### Attribution boundary

Physical storage ownership and contractual
cost-bearing responsibility are different.

The presence of a payer's creation bond does
not establish that all subsequent storage for
that task or offer is refundable.

The claimable record's beneficiary does not
automatically establish who finances its
persistent storage.

The 257-byte shared_or_unknown allocation
must not be arbitrarily assigned to the first
task creator merely because that transaction
first created the record.

Retained audit, terminal, funding and bond
records may require long-term storage backing.

The model does not establish future mutation
bounds, migration safety, universal storage
costs or general refund eligibility.

### Regression

`npm run sandbox:transition-matrix`

Next: M2/07E/2B — explicitly define funding
responsibility by record category and prove
that refundable capacity remains protected
against future storage obligations.

The current contract remains unchanged.
No general refund authorization is granted.
Production funds remain NOT APPROVED.

## M2/07E/2B/1 — Isolated storage cost policy

Base commit: `0c16b18`.
Date: 2026-11-03.

### Evidence

A fresh 21-transition NEAR Sandbox matrix was
processed by the isolated cost-policy model.

Verified results:

- 12 independently tracked storage contributions.
- Each contribution preserves:
  total = consumed + unused + released.
- Five manipulated scenarios rejected.
- Physical storage reconciliation PASS.
- Rust contract and WASM unchanged.

### Model totals

| Component | Byte-equivalent |
|---|---:|
| Original storage contributions | 24576 |
| Attributed persistent customer storage | 2082 |
| Hypothetical unused capacity | 22312 |
| Previously released credit | 182 |
| Separate shared storage | 257 |

Accounting:

24576 = 2082 + 22312 + 182

2339 = 2082 + 257

Existing on-chain storage reserve after the
tested rebates is 24394 byte-equivalent.

The proposed accounting split is:

24394 = 2082 + 22312

### Proposed cost-bearing assumptions

- Task creation bond covers task record
  and task creation bond storage.
- Task funding bond covers task funding,
  settlement marker and buyer claimable creation
  in this tested unmatched lifecycle.
- Offer creation bond covers offer record
  and offer creation bond storage.
- Offer funding bond covers its original
  funding record until deletion.
- The first provider claimable creation is
  provisionally charged to the corresponding
  offer funding bond.
- Shared storage remains separately backed.

These are design assumptions, not established
refund entitlements.

### Security limitations

- Future storage obligations are not bounded.
- Different lifecycle outcomes may have
  different storage requirements.
- Storage costs can depend on account and slot
  identifier lengths.
- Claimable ownership does not automatically
  establish storage cost responsibility.
- The model parses Sandbox evidence and uses
  expected fixture values; it is not itself
  an authenticated on-chain ledger.
- Adversarial tests demonstrate rejection of
  the tested mutations, not exhaustive security.
- General refunds and migration remain unproven.
- No new withdrawal or payout rights are enabled.

Optional regression:

1. npm run sandbox:transition-matrix
2. npm run sandbox:cost-policy -- /path/to/log

Next: M2/07E/2B/2 — future mutation reserve,
global backing invariants and zero-capital stress.

Production funds remain NOT APPROVED.

## M2/07E/2B/2A — Global backing stress model

Base commit: `5149b76`.
Date: 2026-11-03.

### Verified evidence

- 21 successful Sandbox storage transitions.
- 22 backing samples, including baseline.
- Actual account balances and physical storage.
- Current economic, collateral, claimable,
  pending and storage reserve liabilities.
- Conservative backing guard reconstructed.
- Hypothetical consumed/unused backing model.
- Five adversarial input mutations rejected.
- Rust contract and WASM unchanged.

### Final accounting

Measured physical storage growth: 2339 bytes.

Attributed consumed storage: 2082 bytes.
Shared storage: 257 bytes.
Unused contribution capacity: 22312 bytes.
Previously credited storage refunds: 182 bytes.

Recorded remaining storage reserve:
24394 byte-equivalent.

The observed accounting identities hold:

2339 = 2082 + 257

24394 = 2082 + 22312

### Treasury margin scenarios

All margins below are counterfactual.
They reduce the starting treasury balance while
preserving observed transaction balance changes.

| Margin | Conservative | Shadow |
|---|---|---|
| 0 NEAR | FAIL | FAIL |
| 0.015 NEAR | FAIL | FAIL |
| 0.060 NEAR | PASS | PASS |
| 0.120 NEAR | PASS | PASS |

Approximate implied minimum initial margins
for the sampled transition trace:

Conservative: 0.04514410 NEAR.
Shadow: 0.02302421 NEAR.

These are conditional model thresholds,
NOT proven safe funding requirements.

### Future capacity test

The model tested incremental consumption of
unused capacity without new storage deposits.

The following requests were algebraically
covered within the simulated reserve:

0, 2048, 4096, 8192 and 22312 bytes.

A 22313-byte request exceeded the modeled
22312-byte unused capacity and was rejected.

The assumed future minimum was 2048 bytes.
This is a test parameter, not a proven upper
bound for future legitimate state changes.

Converting unused storage reserves to an
equal claimable liability does not by itself
create free capital.

### Unresolved security boundaries

- Actual low-margin Sandbox deployments
  have not been run for these scenarios.
- No universal future storage growth bound.
- No proof of every lifecycle and callback.
- The shadow split is not persisted on-chain.
- Model calculations use a fixed verified
  transaction trace and known fixture categories.
- Storage ownership and refund entitlement
  remain separate questions.
- No migration safety proof.
- No permission to relax withdrawal backing.
- No general refund authorization.

### Regression

1. npm run sandbox:backing-probe
2. npm run sandbox:backing-stress -- /path/to/log

Next: M2/07E/2B/2B — actual low-margin
Sandbox deployments, native payout checks
and alternative lifecycle stress.

Production funds remain NOT APPROVED.
